    <h2>Lasagna is a type of pasta food.</h2>
    <p>An Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating
    with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), 
    béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, 
    mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices.[3] 
    The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted 
    during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the 
    other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked
    pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>
